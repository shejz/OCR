### Implement and train a custom OCR model with Keras and TensorFlow.
Train a custom Keras/TensorFlow model to recognize alphanumeric characters (i.e., the digits 0-9 and the letters A-Z). And we can use this model to correctly classify handwritten characters in custom input images.

### Deep Learning OCR datasets
