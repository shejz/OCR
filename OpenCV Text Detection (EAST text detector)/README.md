 ## OpenCV’s new EAST text detector to automatically detect the presence of text in natural scene images.
 
 > OpenCV’s EAST text detector is a deep learning model, based on a novel architecture and training pattern. It is capable of:
 1. Running at near real-time at 13 FPS on 720p images 
 2. Obtains state-of-the-art text detection accuracy.

### Why detecting text in natural scene images can be so challenging.
